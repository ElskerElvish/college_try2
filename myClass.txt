myClass is kind of a group but is pre existant. When clicked on it, it will open a group which is the group of all the students in your
class along with the teachers that are associated with the teaching of various subjects in the class. 

If a user clicks on the display pic of the class group, the list of partifcipants will be shown but first there will be some options 
as in instagram. There will be a *exit class(or any other better name)* option that when clicked will lead the user to an explore kind of
page where he/she can find any student in the college. User can either navigate thru different buildings/departments and then to different
classes or search up a perticular class or user etc. If user is in a perticular department, he/she won't be able to search up for someone
who is in other department/building/branch, the search results shown will be for only that perticular department/branch/building he/she is
in.
